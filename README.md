This is the file that reads in the excel Spreadsheets and sets it up for PHP syntax


I have the data the was supplied to me by my client, and I need to make Map and Key pairs for all the values given and thier corresponding out put which is shown in the Data.txt file.

I have added the php file, and the program now fully can read and interpret the Data.txt. 

Now I have to have the program write the code in PHP syntax now. I will use a Key => Pair Array in php which will allow me to write functions referencing those key pairs.
